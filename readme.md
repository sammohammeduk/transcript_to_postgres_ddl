**Alice:** Alright team, thanks for joining. Today, we're discussing the development of a new platform for courtroom case management software. We want to ensure it meets both the technical needs and the requirements from the legal side. Bob, maybe you can start by outlining some core entities we might need?

**Bob:** Sure, Alice. From a systems perspective, the main entities I’m thinking of are Cases, Parties, Judges, Hearings, Documents, and Attorneys. Each of these will have specific attributes. For instance, Cases will have an ID, Case Type, Status, Dates opened and closed, and possibly tags or keywords for easy searching.

**Carol:** That aligns well with what we've heard from stakeholders. The Cases entity will definitely need to capture the type of case — like criminal, civil, family — since different workflows apply. Also, we should include relationships between Parties and Cases, since one party can be involved in many cases, and vice versa.

**David:** From a legal standpoint, it's crucial that we accurately track hearings and motions within a case. So, each Hearing should be linked to a Case, have a scheduled date and time, the Judge assigned, and what the hearing type is — preliminary, trial, sentencing.

**Erin:** On the UX front, we'll want to make sure users can easily search for cases based on various attributes—case number, party name, hearing date, judge. This means we’ll need robust indexing or maybe a dedicated search service.

**Alice:** Good point, Erin. Bob, do you think we should index certain fields specifically?

**Bob:** Definitely. We can index frequently searched attributes like case numbers, party names, and dates. Also, for documents associated with cases, full-text search might be needed.

**Carol:** On the note of documents — I think Document entities should include metadata like upload date, type (e.g., motion, evidence, transcript), and a link to the case and party they belong to. We might also want a permissions model for who can view or edit documents.

**David:** Permissions are critical. For example, some motions or evidence might only be accessible to certain attorneys or judges, depending on confidentiality requirements.

**Erin:** That brings up the UX challenge of role-based views. The interface should adapt based on user permissions—say, a judge sees certain sensitive information that attorneys or clerks don't.

**Alice:** So summarizing: Cases are central, linked to Parties, Hearings, Documents, and Attorneys. We have relationships like many-to-many between Parties and Cases, and one-to-many between Cases and Hearings.

**Bob:** Correct. And adding constraints to maintain data integrity: For example, a Hearing must reference an existing Case and assigned Judge; a Document must be attached to one or more Cases and/or Parties.

**Carol:** What about status constraints? Like a Case can’t be closed if there are upcoming Hearings.

**David:** Absolutely. The system should prevent closing a case prematurely. Maybe we have a status flow control and validation rules for state transitions.

**Erin:** From the frontend perspective, when a user tries to close a case with pending hearings, we can prompt them with warnings.

**Alice:** Okay, great. Are there any other entities or relationships we might be missing?

**Bob:** Possibly Calendars or Schedules for Judges and Courtrooms, linked to Hearings. This would help avoid scheduling conflicts.

**David:** Yes, scheduling is a big issue. It would be good to see availability and conflicts for Judges and Courtrooms.

**Carol:** That might mean entities like Courtrooms and Schedules, and constraints to prevent double booking.

**Erin:** That will also affect search and calendar views in the UI. We can provide a schedule dashboard.

**Alice:** Alright, sounds like we have a solid foundational model. Next steps: Bob and Carol, can you draft an initial ER diagram reflecting these entities and relationships? Erin, start exploring UI design concepts focused on search and role-based views. David, please prepare a list of legal requirements or constraints we should ensure the software enforces.

**Bob:** Will do.

**Carol:** Sounds good.

**Erin:** On it.

**David:** I'll prepare that.

**Alice:** Thanks everyone. Meeting adjourned.

The database is designed to manage comprehensive information related to court cases, including the parties involved, legal representatives, judicial officers, court events, and associated documentation. The structure is relational, meaning that the information is organised across multiple tables with clear links between them, ensuring data integrity and ease of retrieval.

### Core Concepts and Tables

1. **Reference Data**
   This is a foundational table that contains various types of static data used throughout the system. It holds categories such as case types, statuses, hearing types, document types, and roles. This design facilitates flexibility and consistency in categorising other records.

2. **Cases**
   This table represents individual court cases. Each case is uniquely identified and characterised by type, status, and relevant dates (opened and closed). The duration of the case is automatically calculated based on these dates. Cases form the central point to which hearings, parties, attorneys, and documents relate.

3. **Parties**
   This table holds information about entities involved in cases. Parties may be individuals or organisations, distinguished by the presence of personal names or organisation names respectively. The type of party (for example, plaintiff or defendant) is recorded via a reference to the relevant reference data.

4. **Judges and Attorneys**
   Legal professionals are stored in separate tables. Judges have assigned courts or chambers, and attorneys have official bar registration numbers. Both entities are linked to cases and hearings where relevant.

5. **Courtrooms**
   These represent physical locations within the court system where hearings take place. Each has a name and location description.

6. **Hearings**
   Hearings are scheduled court events associated with cases. They record the type of hearing, timing, assigned judge, and courtroom. Notably, the system enforces constraints that prevent overlapping hearing times for the same judge or courtroom, ensuring no scheduling conflicts occur.

7. **Documents**
   This table manages files related to cases and parties, including motions, evidence, and other relevant paperwork. Each document has a type and storage location, supporting comprehensive case documentation management.

### Associative Tables Linking Entities

- **Case Parties**
  This is a linking table that connects parties to cases, capturing the role each party plays in the case (for example, plaintiff, defendant, witness). It allows for many-to-many relationships, meaning a party can be involved in multiple cases in different roles.

- **Case Attorneys**
  Similarly, this table links attorneys to cases, along with their role (such as defence counsel or prosecutor). It supports accurate representation of legal representation across cases.

### Data Integrity and Constraints

The database employs primary keys to uniquely identify records. Foreign keys link related records across tables, ensuring valid and consistent relationships—for example, a hearing must link to an existing case, judge, and courtroom.

Unique constraints maintain data quality, such as ensuring case numbers and attorney bar numbers are not duplicated.

A sophisticated feature of the system is the use of exclusion constraints for hearings. These prevent two hearings from overlapping for the same judge or in the same courtroom by restricting time ranges, which is critical for practical scheduling.

### User and Timestamp Tracking

All tables include audit information—records track who created or last updated them, and when these actions occurred. This supports accountability and traceability within the system.

### Summary

In summary, the database is carefully structured to represent the complex relationships and workflows involved in managing court cases and their associated entities. It is designed to enforce data integrity, prevent scheduling conflicts, and provide rich linkage between cases, participants, legal representatives, hearings, and supporting documents. This structured approach enables the judicial system to manage case information systematically and supports efficient court administration.
