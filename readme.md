**Alice:** Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining today. As you know, we’re here to discuss building a new courtroom case management platform. The goal is to understand the key entities, their attributes, relationships, and constraints. To start, any initial thoughts on what main entities we should consider?

**David:** From a courtroom perspective, the obvious ones are Cases, Judges, Lawyers, and Plaintiffs/Defendants. We’ll also need to capture Hearings or Sessions.

**Emma:** Yes, and don’t forget Evidence. Each case typically has multiple pieces of evidence linked to it.

**Bob:** Right. So, initial entities could be Case, Person (which could be specialized into Judge, Lawyer, Plaintiff, Defendant), Hearing, and Evidence.

**Carol:** For the frontend, we need to think about how to easily filter and view cases by Judge, status, or upcoming hearings. So attributes like case status and hearing date are important.

**Alice:** Good points. Let's break down some attributes per entity. For Case, we could have CaseID, CaseName, FilingDate, Status.

**David:** Status would be like Open, Closed, Adjourned?

**Emma:** Correct. Also, need to consider constraints like a Hearing must be linked to exactly one Case but a Case can have multiple Hearings.

**Bob:** For Person, attributes might be PersonID, Name, Role (Judge, Lawyer, Plaintiff, Defendant), ContactInfo.

**Alice:** Should Role be an attribute or a separate entity?

**Bob:** I’d recommend an attribute to keep it simple, unless role-specific behaviors or data become complex.

**Carol:** Good to know. And for Evidence, attributes could include EvidenceID, Description, Type (Document, Photo, Video), DateSubmitted, and linked to the Case.

**David:** Can Evidence be linked directly to a Hearing? Sometimes Evidence is introduced during Hearings.

**Emma:** That’s a good catch. Maybe the relationship should support that Evidence can be linked to a Case or a specific Hearing.

**Alice:** So a possible constraint is that Evidence must be linked to either one Case or one Hearing, but not both simultaneously.

**Bob:** Or maybe allow Evidence to be linked to multiple Hearings if, say, the same piece is referred to in several hearings.

**Emma:** True, legal cases can be complex that way.

**Carol:** From frontend perspective, we should then allow users to see Evidence at the Case level and at each Hearing level.

**David:** Speaking about Hearings, attributes could be HearingID, Date, Time, Location, Judge assigned.

**Alice:** The Judge assigned to a Hearing means a relationship between Hearing and Person, filtered by Role=Judge.

**Bob:** Right. And we need to enforce constraints that a Hearing has exactly one Judge.

**Emma:** And multiple Lawyers might appear for a Case or for a particular Hearing, so maybe a many-to-many relationship between Lawyers and Hearings.

**Alice:** Let's revisit Persons. We discussed keeping Role as an attribute, but given these multiple specialized relationships, maybe we create sub-entities or use inheritance?

**Bob:** I was thinking of a single Person entity with Role, but we could implement subtypes if needed. That might help enforce role-specific relationship constraints, like only Judges can be assigned to Hearings as presiding authorities.

**Carol:** For the UI, displaying roles clearly when showing persons is helpful, so users know who is who.

**David:** What about case statuses? Should we have fixed statuses or customizable ones?

**Emma:** Fixed would ensure consistency. Think Open, In Progress, Adjourned, Closed.

**Alice:** Sounds good. We can enforce that as an enum constraint on the Case Status attribute.

**Bob:** Also, do we want to track deadlines? Like filing deadlines or hearing dates that must be enforced?

**Emma:** Absolutely. Important for court procedures.

**Alice:** So we can add Deadline attributes, perhaps multiple deadline-related dates linked to Cases and Hearings.

**Carol:** For example, we could have CaseDeadlineDate and HearingDeadlineDate fields.

**David:** How about relationships between Plaintiffs and Defendants within a Case?

**Bob:** Maybe through the Person entity with Role attribute as Plaintiff or Defendant linked to specific Cases.

**Emma:** Exactly. Usually, a Person acts in a role relative to a Case.

**Alice:** So in terms of data modeling, this might imply a relationship entity, say CaseParty, linking Person and Case with Role.

**Bob:** That would also allow the same Person to be a Plaintiff in one Case and a Defendant in another.

**Carol:** Good point. The UI needs to reflect that so users understand each person's role per case.

**David:** I want to circle back to Evidence linking: we agreed it can link to Cases and Hearings. Are there any constraints on the number of Evidence items?

**Emma:** No strict limits. A case can have zero or many Evidence items.

**Alice:** Understood. We’d allow zero to many relationships.

**Bob:** What about confidentiality? Should we track permissions per Evidence or Case?

**Emma:** That’s crucial. Some Evidence might be sealed or restricted.

**Alice:** That might mean an attribute like AccessLevel on Evidence and Case, with constraints to control who can view what.

**Carol:** That impacts UI functionality for logging in users and access filtering.

**David:** Speaking of users, do we need a User entity separate from Person to manage login credentials?

**Alice:** Usually yes, User for authentication and authorization, Person for legal roles.

**Bob:** Links between User and Person can be one-to-one or one-to-many if a user manages multiple roles.

**Carol:** And in UI, some users may only see specific parts based on their User role.

**David:** Great summary. We talked about entities: Case, Person, Hearing, Evidence, User. Relationships like CaseParty (Person-Case-Role), Hearings linked to Cases and Judges, Evidence linked to Cases or Hearings, User linked to Person.

**Alice:** Perfect. Are there other constraints or relationships anyone wants to mention before we wrap up?

**Emma:** Just that dates should be validated — hearing dates can't be before case filing dates.

**Bob:** Good constraint. We’ll enforce that.

**Carol:** And UI should warn users about these validation errors in real time.

**David:** Excellent. Thanks, everyone. Looks like we have a solid foundation to start designing the platform.

**Alice:** Thanks all. We’ll follow up with diagrams and initial schemas based on this discussion.

This database is designed to manage court case information, including involved people, hearings, evidence, and related reference data. Below is an explanation of how the data is structured, tailored for non-technical stakeholders.

### Overall Structure and Purpose
The database organises data about legal proceedings, specifically court cases, the people involved, hearings, and evidence. It also includes supporting reference data that standardises terms such as case statuses, access levels, evidence types, and roles people play in cases.

---

### Key Entities and Their Roles

#### 1. **Reference Data**
- This table stores standardised codes and categories used across the system.
- Examples include types of evidence (like documents, photos), case statuses (open, closed), and access levels determining who can view certain information.
- This allows consistent use of common terms throughout the database.

#### 2. **Person**
- Represents any individual involved in the court system.
- This includes judges, lawyers, plaintiffs, defendants, or other relevant roles.
- Basic contact information such as email and phone number is stored here.

#### 3. **App User**
- Stores login details for individuals needing access to the system.
- Each app user is linked to a person record, tying credentials to an individual.
- Passwords are securely stored as hashes (encrypted).

#### 4. **Court Case**
- The central entity representing a legal case.
- Contains case name, dates (filing and optional deadline), status, and access permissions.
- The status reflects whether the case is open, adjourned, closed, etc.
- Access levels control visibility and permissions for sensitive cases.

#### 5. **Hearing**
- Represents scheduled court sessions linked to a specific court case.
- Each hearing has a date/time, location (physical or virtual), a judge who presides, and possibly an associated deadline for submissions related to that hearing.

#### 6. **Case Party**
- Links persons to a court case, specifying the role they play (e.g., plaintiff, defendant).
- This clarifies each person’s position and involvement in the case.

#### 7. **Evidence**
- Records pieces of evidence submitted for a case.
- Each item has a description, type, submission date, and access level restrictions.
- Evidence types might include documents, photos, or videos.

#### 8. **Hearing Evidence**
- A join table that links evidence items to specific hearings where they are presented or referenced.
- Supports many-to-many relationships, recognising that evidence can relate to multiple hearings.

---

### Data Relationships and Integrity
- Many entities are linked via unique identifiers (UUIDs) ensuring each record is completely distinct.
- Foreign keys enforce valid relationships; for example, a hearing must be linked to a valid case and judge.
- The reference data ensures that standardised codes are used (e.g., the status of a case must come from predefined statuses).
- Timestamps and user information track when and by whom records are created or updated, supporting auditability.

---

### Example Use Case Flow:
1. A new **court case** is filed, with its name, filing date, and current status recorded.
2. **People** involved including judges and parties (plaintiffs, defendants) are added.
3. **Hearings** are scheduled for particular dates and linked to the case and a presiding judge.
4. Various **evidence items** are submitted and classified by type.
5. Evidence is linked to hearings where it is presented or discussed.

---

### Benefits of This Model
- **Clear organisation** of complex court case data and related entities.
- **Traceability** of individuals' roles and responsibilities.
- **Controlled access** to sensitive information through access levels.
- **Standardised vocabulary** via reference data ensures common understanding.
- **Support for auditing** through created/updated metadata.
