- Dan (Legal Consultant)
- Eve (UX Designer)
- Frank (QA Lead)
- Grace (Business Analyst)

---

**Meeting 1**

Carol: Welcome everyone. Today we start discussing the new Courtoom Case Management Software platform. Let's kick off with high-level goals.

Alice: Sure. Our main objective is to build a system that tracks court cases efficiently, managing case details, parties, schedules, and documents.

Dan: Party management is crucial. We have plaintiffs, defendants, lawyers, and judges.

Bob: Agreed. So entities could include Case, Party, Lawyer, Judge, Schedule, and Document.

Grace: We should clarify attributes for each entity. For example, Case could have case number, type, status.

Carol: Perfect. Let's draft these out and assign responsibilities.

---

**Meeting 2**

Alice: Picking up from last time, how about relationships? A Case relates to multiple Parties; a Lawyer may represent multiple Parties.

Bob: Yeah, that's a many-to-many relationship between Parties and Lawyers.

Eve: From UX view, it’s important to show who represents whom clearly.

Dan: Also, Judges preside over cases - a one-to-many between Judge and Case.

Carol: Let’s note that. Also, we need constraints: a Case must have at least one Plaintiff and one Defendant.

Grace: I'll document that. Also, what about case statuses? Open, Closed, On Hold?

Frank: QA suggests they be enforced by business logic to prevent invalid transitions.

---

**Meeting 3**

Bob: Revisiting Parties, do we consider Parties as individuals or organizations?

Dan: Both. Sometimes plaintiffs are companies.

Alice: So Party entity needs a type attribute: Individual vs Organization.

Grace: Good catch. Also, what about contact info? It may be needed for notifications.

Eve: Definitely. We should design easy input forms for contacts.

---

**Meeting 4**

Carol: Back on Case attributes, do we want to include filing date, court location?

Alice: Yes. Filing date is important for timelines, court location helps assign judges.

Dan: Location is also needed for jurisdiction rules.

Bob: So Court entity?

Carol: Possibly. Or maybe Court is an attribute of Case.

Grace: Let's table the Court entity for now and decide later.

---

**Meeting 5**

Eve: About Document management – should documents be linked directly to Cases or also to Parties?

Alice: Link primarily to Cases, but allow tagging to Parties.

Frank: Also, document types: pleadings, evidence, judgments.

Bob: That suggests a DocumentType entity or enum.

Carol: Let's standardize document types with constraints on allowed values.

---

**Meeting 6**

Dan: On constraints: a Lawyer must be licensed in jurisdiction of the Court for a Case.

Grace: That implies we track licensing info per Lawyer.

Alice: Agreed. Add licensing jurisdiction as Lawyer attribute.

Bob: Also, ensure Lawyer assignments respect this constraint.

---

**Meeting 7**

Bob: Circling back to scheduling – hearings, deadlines?

Alice: Schedule entity linked to Case makes sense, with date/time and type (hearing, deadline).

Eve: We should provide calendar views.

Frank: Need validation on schedule conflicts for Judges and Courtrooms.

Carol: Good point. Let's add constraints for scheduling conflicts.

---

**Meeting 8**

Grace: On relationship cardinality, can a Judge preside over multiple Cases simultaneously?

Dan: Typically, yes.

Bob: So Judge to Case is one-to-many.

Alice: Agreed.

Bob: And Case has one assigned Judge at a time.

Eve: For UI, should be clear who’s presiding.

---

**Meeting 9**

Alice: Revisiting Parties, what about roles? Plaintiff, Defendant, Witness.

Carol: Maybe a PartyRole entity.

Grace: Or an attribute on Party per Case relationship.

Bob: The latter, as role depends on the Case context.

---

**Meeting 10**

Dan: On constraints, a Case cannot move to Closed without a final Judgment document.

Alice: So a business rule checks for Judgment document before closing Case.

Frank: QA can implement test cases for that.

---

**Meeting 11**

Eve: About Lawyers representing multiple Parties, do we track representation period?

Bob: Good question. Could be an attribute on Lawyer-Party relationship: start date, end date.

Grace: That will help with accuracy in cases spanning years.

Alice: Let’s add that.

---

**Meeting 12**

Carol: Court entity revisit – would it make sense to model Courtrooms as sub-entities?

Bob: We could have Court and Courtroom entities, Courtroom belonging to Court.

Dan: Helps for scheduling and resource management.

Alice: Let's split Court and Courtroom.

---

**Meeting 13**

Alice: Revisiting Document linking, should documents have versions?

Eve: Very useful for edits.

Bob: Implement DocumentVersion entity or attributes.

Carol: Sounds good.

---

**Meeting 14**

Dan: Can a Party appear in multiple Cases?

Bob: Yes, definitely.

Grace: So Party to Case is many-to-many.

Alice: With roles per Case, as noted before.

---

**Meeting 15**

Frank: On constraints, Schedule should prevent double booking Courtrooms.

Bob: Building validations for scheduling.

Alice: Also, avoid Judges being double booked.

---

**Meeting 16**

Grace: Revisiting statuses, any constraints on transitions?

Carol: Yes, rules like Open -> On Hold -> Open or Closed.

Dan: Can't reopen Closed without special permission.

Alice: Will encode rules in workflow.

---

**Meeting 17**

Bob: For Parties who are Organizations, do we model contacts separately?

Eve: Yes, Organizations often have multiple contacts.

Grace: So PartyContact entity related to Party.

Alice: Let's add.

---

**Meeting 18**

Carol: Back to Lawyers, track bar association memberships?

Dan: Could be useful for verifications.

Bob: Add attribute or separate entity.

Grace: We can start with attribute and expand later.

---

**Meeting 19**

Alice: Revisiting relationship constraints – Case must have assigned Judge before scheduling hearings.

Frank: Fail schedule creation otherwise.

Carol: Add business rule.

---

**Meeting 20**

Eve: On UX, can we have dashboards by Case status, upcoming hearings?

Alice: We'll design APIs to support that.

Bob: Need to track key dates on Case.

---

**Meeting 21**

Grace: Revisiting document types – should Evidence be a parent type with subtypes?

Bob: Makes sense.

Alice: Implement document type hierarchy.

---

**Meeting 22**

Dan: On representation, can Lawyers represent both Plaintiff and Defendant in different Cases?

Bob: Yes, no conflict at database level.

Eve: UI should reflect representation per Case clearly.

---

**Meeting 23**

Carol: Revisiting scheduling, what about rescheduling constraints?

Alice: Notify affected parties.

Frank: We need audit trail on schedule changes.

---

**Meeting 24**

Grace: On case outcomes – track verdicts?

Dan: Yes, outcome is important attribute.

Bob: Add Verdict entity related to Case.

---

**Meeting 25**

Alice: Revisiting constraints, cannot delete Case with active Schedules or Documents.

Frank: Enforce referential integrity.

Carol: Documented.

---

**Meeting 26**

Eve: On Parties, can multiple Contacts be primary?

Bob: Only one primary contact per Party.

Grace: Add constraint.

---

**Meeting 27**

Dan: Revisiting Lawyers, track specialization areas?

Alice: That may affect case assignments.

Bob: Add attribute specialization in Lawyer.

---

**Meeting 28**

Carol: Back to Courtrooms – add capacity attribute?

Eve: Useful for planning.

Bob: Adding.

---

**Meeting 29**

Frank: On workflows, adding automatic status updates?

Alice: Based on events like submission of Judgment, auto-close Case.

Carol: Great enhancement.

---

**Meeting 30**

Carol: Summarizing: we have main entities - Case, Party, Lawyer, Judge, Document, Schedule, Court, Courtroom. Attributes and relationships defined. Constraints captured. Next steps: detailed data modeling.

Alice: Thanks all for participation.

End of Transcript.

---

This database has been carefully structured to manage information related to court proceedings, participants, and related documents. The design ensures clarity and organisation of data for easy retrieval and reporting, suitable for judicial administration or case management systems. Below is a plain English explanation of the database model with emphasis on its entities and their relationships.

---

### Overview of Core Concepts

- **Court and Courtroom**: The system records details about courts and their specific courtrooms, including location, name, and capacity.
- **Judges**: Each judge is linked to a court and can be assigned to cases.
- **Cases**: A core entity representing legal cases with attributes like case number, type, status, dates, assigned judge, and court.
- **Parties and Roles**: Individuals or organisations involved in cases, having a specified role within each case.
- **Lawyers and Specializations**: Lawyers are modelled with licensing info and can have multiple specializations. Their relationships to parties they represent are tracked with start and end dates.
- **Schedules**: Represent hearings or deadlines related to cases, linked to judges and courtrooms.
- **Documents and Versions**: Documents linked to cases, with support for version control and ability to tag related parties.
- **Verdicts**: Captures the outcome for closed cases.

---

### Reference Data Tables

Several tables define fixed sets of types or statuses used throughout the system — these are known as reference tables. They standardise codes and descriptions for sets such as:

- **Case Status (`ref_case_status`)** – E.g., Open, Closed, Pending.
- **Case Type (`ref_case_type`)** – E.g., Civil, Criminal, Family.
- **Party Type (`ref_party_type`)** – Individual or Organisation.
- **Contact Type (`ref_contact_type`)** – E.g., Email, Phone.
- **Document Type (`ref_document_type`)** – Defines types of documents, allowing a hierarchical structure where each type can have a parent.
- **Schedule Type (`ref_schedule_type`)** – Types of scheduled events, such as hearings or deadlines.
- **Specialization (`ref_specialization`)** – Legal specialisations for lawyers.
- **Party Role (`ref_party_role`)** – Defines the role a party plays in a case, e.g., Plaintiff, Defendant.

These reference tables ensure consistency when assigning types or statuses, improving data quality and simplifying reporting.

---

### Main Entities

#### Court and Courtroom

- A **Court** represents a legal institution identified by name and location.
- Each **Courtroom** belongs to one court and may have a capacity indicating how many people it can accommodate.

#### Judge

- Judges are real persons linked to one court.
- Complete with first and last names.
- A judge can be assigned to multiple cases and schedules.

#### Party

- Represents any person or organisation involved in court cases.
- Identified by name and categorised by party type (individual or organisation).

#### Lawyer

- Lawyers include personal details and professional licensing info, such as license number, expiration date, and jurisdiction.
- Lawyers can represent multiple parties over time.

---

### Cases and Their Participants

#### Case

- Each case has a unique case number.
- Linked to one case type and status.
- It records filing and closure dates.
- Associated with one court and one assigned judge.
- Contains an outcome description and an automatically calculated flag indicating if the case is closed based on status.

#### Case Party

- Joins parties to cases with defined roles (e.g., Plaintiff or Defendant).
- Enforces uniqueness to prevent duplicate assignments of the same party-role combination to a case.

#### Party Contact

- Stores contact details for parties.
- Each contact has a type (like email or phone) and a value.
- Allows one primary contact per party, ensuring a clear main contact method is designated.

#### Lawyer-Party Relationships

- **Lawyer Party** tracks which parties a lawyer represents, including the start and optional end of representation dates.
- This allows historical and current representation data.
- **Lawyer Specialization** captures the many-to-many relationship between lawyers and their legal expertise areas.

---

### Scheduling Hearings and Events

- **Schedule** entities record specific scheduled events related to cases.
- Each schedule is linked to a case, judge, courtroom, and a schedule type.
- Start and end times for each event are kept for precise calendar or timeline management.

---

### Document Management

- **Document** records hold metadata including type, title, and optional description, each linked to a case.
- Document types are hierarchical, allowing broad or specific categorisation.
- **Document Version** supports multiple sequential versions of each document, tracking file paths for storage.
- **Document Party** links documents to parties for tagging or relevance indication.

---

### Verdicts on Cases

- The **Verdict** table holds outcomes for cases that have been closed.
- Each verdict is linked distinctly to one case.
- Includes the verdict date and optional descriptive text about the result.

---

### Data Integrity and Usability Features

- Use of UUIDs for primary keys across entities provides a high degree of uniqueness and security.
- Foreign key constraints enforce links between related data, ensuring referential integrity.
- Unique indexes on key fields (e.g., case number, lawyers’ license numbers) prevent duplicate records and improve retrieval speeds.
- Timestamp fields on most tables (created and updated datetime) along with the recorded user who created or last updated the data support audit trails.
- Computed column in the case table automatically flags if a case is considered closed, reducing errors and simplifying queries.

---

### Summary

This database is comprehensively designed to cover the lifecycle of legal cases from initial filing through scheduling, representation, documentation, and verdict. The use of reference data helps maintain standardisation, while detailed linking tables manage complex relationships such as lawyers representing multiple parties or parties playing different roles in various cases.

The thorough audit fields and versioning ensure accountability and document control, making the system robust for legal administration and reporting purposes.
